# DyBASIC
DyBASIC is an interpreted language made as a project of mines. The full name is Dyno Softworks BASIC, as it is meant to be released under the Dyno Softworks name.

## Build Instructions
For Windows, you really could just want to load up Visual Studio, import these files by any means of your choosing, and run the solution. For command-line based building (Linux, for example), I'll eventually have those files up to be able to build it from that. Sorry for the lack of information when it comes to building the interpreter it's self.
