# DyBASIC
DyBASIC is an interpreted language made as a project of mines. The full name is Dyno Softworks BASIC, as it is meant to be released under the Dyno Softworks name.

DyBASIC is not meant to be fast or exactly usable. It is however meant to be a project that I can focus on, allowing me to see my progress as a C# developer.
